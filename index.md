## Team Goals
_First and foremost our team goal is to get an A+ on this project. But more than that, we hope that by the end of the project we will have created an intuitive and effective UI design that we can all be proud of and include in a portfolio for prospective future employers. We also want to become more familiar with various prototyping tools, learn new skills which we can take beyond the course and obtain a stronger knowledge of user-centered design concepts and practises_
