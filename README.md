# Human Computer Interaction Project
This is a Human-computer interaction project I helped develop as part of a team for my University HCI course.

The project was developed in 5 stages, each of which has a corresponding branch in this repository

This project may be modified over time to make it adapted and personalized for my Portfolio.
