            end of the project we will have created an intuitive and effective UI design that we can all be proud of and
            include in a portfolio for prospective future employers. We also want to become more familiar with various
            prototyping tools, learn new skills which we can take beyond the course and obtain a stronger knowledge of
            user-centered design concepts and practises.

		<h3>1. Map Activity and Events Recommender</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> With many events happening around the city, it is often challenging to track and
						be aware of the available opportunities. Currently, people will learn about events
						through certain social media accounts, but this information is spread out and not
						consolidated anywhere. This is challenging when someone is either travelling to
						a new city looking for something to do, or is a current resident who is trying to
						learn about local events that they can attend, meet new people, and have fun at.
						notifications can alert the user anytime of events happening around them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> As many organizations put great efforts into hosting events that help build a
						stronger sense of community, their work is often unnoticed as many people may
						be too busy to learn about what is happening around them in the city. This is a
						missed opportunity for people to come together to socialize and learn about
						different cultures and ways of life.<br>
						Many people in our society end up neglecting their social life due to work and
						other obligations. They forget to socialize and build meaningful relationships with
						others in their community, which is key to living a balanced, connected, happy,
						and healthy life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A platform that consolidates all the events happening in a city and makes
						personalized recommendations to the user and notifies them of opportunities.
						This way, the problem of sparse and limited information can be resolved and
						people would have greater knowledge about events that they would be interested
						in attending. This can also help event hosters see more engagement and
						ultimately help build a stronger community.
					</P>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p>	This would be in the form of a mobile application as push notifications can<br>
						alert the user anytime of events happening around them.

		<h3>2. Fitness Planner App (Smart notification and planning system)</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> When people begin pursuing fitness goals they can face a variety of challenges:
						People may not know what exercises will be best to achieve their fitness goals,
						have difficulty learning the motions of new exercises, have trouble staying
						committed to their workout schedule, and may not have the same equipment
						availability as others. Although a personal trainer helps solve a few of these
						problems, it can still be too expensive for many individuals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Physical fitness can be a very important tool as it helps lead to a healthier
						lifestyle and improve mental and physical well-being. Moreover a lack of physical
						fitness may lead to a higher risk of long term health issues that could prevent the
						user from living their desired life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile fitness app which will ask the user what their fitness goals
						and preferences are so it can construct a fitness plan. This plan will help achieve their
						goals based on things like availability, age, current fitness level, and equipment
						availability. The app would help individuals keep track of their fitness goals and
						also have the information that they need to achieve their goals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will give notifications to help the user stay motivated and on
						track. A mobile application would be accessible anywhere and anytime so a user
						can get a workout whenever convenient for them, rather than being limited 
						to working at home or at the gym.

		<h3>3. Health Tracking App (Hydration, heart rate, food intake, and other health metrics)</h3>
	
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> As people begin to live busier lives, it can be easy to forget about taking care of
						one’s well-being. Many individuals find it hard to monitor their health metrics and
						lifestyle with simple tasks such as forgetting to drink the necessary amount of
						water per day, getting the proper nutrients and vitamins, or failing to realize if vital
						organ functions are working correctly. The challenge here is to provide
						easy-to-understand health information so a user can take proactive approaches
						to living a healthier life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Fitness is crucial when it comes to taking care of health and avoiding illnesses or
						diseases. If individuals are unable to identify their health information, they may
						not be sure about their current fitness levels which could cause them to miss
						information that could have allowed them to take action sooner.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application could help those who are trying to keep their fitness metrics
						in check. Through interactive notifications, users can track if they are hydrated,
						eating the right amount, and moving enough in their day-to-day life. The health
						tracking app could gather and keep track of information about the user to
						personalize health plans. When someone doesn’t have good physical health,
						it can trickle down to other vital components such as mental health, which can
						affect the user’s overall life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will be used to provide quick and easy recommendations to
						enhance the user’s wellbeing.

			<h3>Map Activity & Events Recommender</h3>
			<p> Our project is a mobile application available on iOS and Android that will connect event
				planners with individuals looking to participate in activities happening in their city. The app
				will display a map of the city the user is currently in, similar to Google Maps, with pins
				dropped in locations that correspond to activities such as “impromptu basketball”, “secret
				donut shop”, “city scavenger hunt” and other events. The system will be used when a user
				opens the application, explores the events happening around them, selects an event to view
				the location and details, and can click a button to open the address in Google Maps and
				navigate to the event location. For event planners, they will be able to tap a button to create
				an event, provide information like the address, time, and description, add keywords that
				describe the event, and press submit which will then drop a pin on the map for all users to
				see. The system is meant to be used by any individuals over the age of 18 that have spare
				time and an interest in exploring the city and participating in various activities. It will also be
				used by any small businesses or organizations that wish to put together events.

			<h3>Event Organizers</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Local Buisnesses</h4>
					<p> These businesses may be interested in creating unique marketing
						campaigns that involve customers visiting their location. Examples of
						this include “Free donuts for first 50 customers” or “Spin the wheel to
						win a prize, while getting coffee from our shop”.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>City Planners (Government Officials)</h4>
					<p> The government may want to organize events such as firework shows
						during holidays like Canada Day. This app would allow them to design
						a more robust experience and inform more citizens of what is planned.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Charities and Non-Profit Organizations</h4>
					<p> These organizations may put together charity events and fundraisers
						with games and activities to entice people to visit and get informed
						about their mission.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Everday People</h4>
					<p> Our application is really intended for use by anyone who wants
						to organize an event, whether its something official and formal like
						a professional conference for a corporation or just an informal meetup
						between a group of freinds.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Event Participants</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Any local citizen over the age of 18</h4>
					<p>	As this app is meant to be accessible by everyone over 18, this
						ensures the safety of individuals being able to check out any events
						that cater to them.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Any local citizen over the age of 18</h4>
					<p> When a tourist is visiting a new city, they may be interested in
						checking out local events during the duration of their visit to make the
						most of their experience.

		<h3>Ask - Surveys & Questionnaires</h3>
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<p> The questions were asked to ascertain certain characteristics and understand the users who
				would be interested in this product. We interviewed 26 people that could be potential users
				of the application, and we had a large variety of people ranging from different ages,
				backgrounds, lifestyles, etc. From the responses given, here are a few things that were
				noticed: The majority of users were not familiar with event planning applications. Many
				people only go to these events once or twice a week (mainly because they find out about
				these events from all over the place), and the average person who replied was not a full
				blown introvert or extrovert, the average was a 7. Doing a survey was very beneficial for our
				research as it did give us a better understanding of our audience (the average user), we
				could elicit replies quick and easy, and we were able to distribute the survey to many people.
				Combined, these factors are what went well for us. What went poorly was there was a
				misunderstanding with a question. When people were asked how they found their events,
				they didn’t seem to comprehend the question fully based on replies given. The wording was
				not clear, leading to lots of outliers. To improve, we could have changed the wording to be
				more clear and concise so the responders of the survey give more accurate answers. If we
				did that differently, the better responses would have helped.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Learn - Competitive Product Survey</h3>
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<p> Pre-existing products were reviewed in order to set a base for which features would need to
				be implemented, and which features are flawed and should not be implemented in our app.
				We reviewed four most frequently used event apps. By looking at these apps, we got a
				better idea of features that would need to be implemented within our system. As many of
				these competitive products have been around for a long time now, they can be used as a
				base point to build on and improve products. The features that we noticed that were
				impressive and we would like to implement and adopt can be found in the appendix.
				Competitive product surveys were beneficial as they allowed us to analyse, see and
				experience what similar apps in the market are currently looking like, and help define our
				own app’s functional requirements. One of the main issues that we encountered during this
				research was that a lot of apps had overlap, making it difficult to figure out which system or
				approach would be best implemented. Another issue looking into each product’s functionality
				and getting the pros and cons was time-consuming. For next time, it would be better if we
				did the competitive product survey with an audience and asked them questions about it to
				get more opinions. 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Try - Scenario Testing</h3>
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<p>	Three different scenarios were brainstormed to try and succinctly cover and express our
				application’s possible functionalities. At the same time we tried to tailor each of these
				scenarios to serve as an embodiment of different potential user perspectives like that of a
				tourist or small business owner. These were given to six potential users to elicit feedback
				and it was a great way to get feedback on the different functionalities that we would like to
				have in our app. In terms of what went well, some of the scenarios got the interviewees
				really excited about the application as they had either never heard of an event planner app
				like ours and really wanted to have something like it. The scenarios were good at eliciting
				more elaboration from some of the interviewees; getting what they thought about the 
				application and based on the three scenarios, the interviewees had a good understanding of
				the system. Some participants thought that the scenarios were too specific and were
				confused, so they often needed guiding questions to give proper feedback. Others thought
				they were too general and they forgot the main functionality of the app and would get lost in
				them. Next time, we should first use some other more initializing research methods that can
				inform our scenarios and help us flesh them out better. Finally, having more than three
				scenarios with a good mix of specific and general cases could help us cover more ground as
				there seems to be a hit-and-miss for how general or specific the scenarios should be.
