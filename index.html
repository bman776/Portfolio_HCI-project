        <p>
            First and foremost our team goal is to get an A+ on this project. But more than that, we hope that by the
            end of the project we will have created an intuitive and effective UI design that we can all be proud of and
            include in a portfolio for prospective future employers. We also want to become more familiar with various
            prototyping tools, learn new skills which we can take beyond the course and obtain a stronger knowledge of
            user-centered design concepts and practises.

		<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
		<p>Project Ideas: <br>
			1. Map Activity & Events Recommender<br>
				Problem:<br>
				With many events happening around the city, it is often challenging to track and<br>
				be aware of the available opportunities. Currently, people will learn about events<br>
				through certain social media accounts, but this information is spread out and not<br>
				consolidated anywhere. This is challenging when someone is either travelling to<br>
				a new city looking for something to do, or is a current resident who is trying to<br>
				learn about local events that they can attend, meet new people, and have fun at.<br>
				ifications can alert the user anytime of events happening around them.<br>
				<br>
			2. Fitness Planner App (Smart notification and planning system)<br>
				Problem:<br>
				When people begin pursuing fitness goals they can face a variety of challenges:<br>
				People may not know what exercises will be best to achieve their fitness goals,<br>
				have difficulty learning the motions of new exercises, have trouble staying<br>
				committed to their workout schedule, and may not have the same equipment<br>
				availability as others. Although a personal trainer helps solve a few of these<br>
				problems, it can still be too expensive for many individuals.<br>
				<br>
			3. Health Tracking App (Hydration, heart rate, food intake, and other health metrics)<br>
				Problem:<br>
				As people begin to live busier lives, it can be easy to forget about taking care of<br>
				oneâ€™s well-being. Many individuals find it hard to monitor their health metrics and<br>
				lifestyle with simple tasks such as forgetting to drink the necessary amount of<br>
				water per day, getting the proper nutrients and vitamins, or failing to realize if vital<br>
				organ functions are working correctly. The challenge here is to provide<br>
				easy-to-understand health information so a user can take proactive approaches<br>
				to living a healthier life.
