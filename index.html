            end of the project we will have created an intuitive and effective UI design that we can all be proud of and
            include in a portfolio for prospective future employers. We also want to become more familiar with various
            prototyping tools, learn new skills which we can take beyond the course and obtain a stronger knowledge of
            user-centered design concepts and practises.

		<h3>1. Map Activity and Events Recommender</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> With many events happening around the city, it is often challenging to track and
						be aware of the available opportunities. Currently, people will learn about events
						through certain social media accounts, but this information is spread out and not
						consolidated anywhere. This is challenging when someone is either travelling to
						a new city looking for something to do, or is a current resident who is trying to
						learn about local events that they can attend, meet new people, and have fun at.
						notifications can alert the user anytime of events happening around them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> As many organizations put great efforts into hosting events that help build a
						stronger sense of community, their work is often unnoticed as many people may
						be too busy to learn about what is happening around them in the city. This is a
						missed opportunity for people to come together to socialize and learn about
						different cultures and ways of life.<br>
						Many people in our society end up neglecting their social life due to work and
						other obligations. They forget to socialize and build meaningful relationships with
						others in their community, which is key to living a balanced, connected, happy,
						and healthy life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A platform that consolidates all the events happening in a city and makes
						personalized recommendations to the user and notifies them of opportunities.
						This way, the problem of sparse and limited information can be resolved and
						people would have greater knowledge about events that they would be interested
						in attending. This can also help event hosters see more engagement and
						ultimately help build a stronger community.
					</P>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p>	This would be in the form of a mobile application as push notifications can<br>
						alert the user anytime of events happening around them.

		<h3>2. Fitness Planner App (Smart notification and planning system)</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> When people begin pursuing fitness goals they can face a variety of challenges:
						People may not know what exercises will be best to achieve their fitness goals,
						have difficulty learning the motions of new exercises, have trouble staying
						committed to their workout schedule, and may not have the same equipment
						availability as others. Although a personal trainer helps solve a few of these
						problems, it can still be too expensive for many individuals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Physical fitness can be a very important tool as it helps lead to a healthier
						lifestyle and improve mental and physical well-being. Moreover a lack of physical
						fitness may lead to a higher risk of long term health issues that could prevent the
						user from living their desired life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile fitness app which will ask the user what their fitness goals
						and preferences are so it can construct a fitness plan. This plan will help achieve their
						goals based on things like availability, age, current fitness level, and equipment
						availability. The app would help individuals keep track of their fitness goals and
						also have the information that they need to achieve their goals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will give notifications to help the user stay motivated and on
						track. A mobile application would be accessible anywhere and anytime so a user
						can get a workout whenever convenient for them, rather than being limited 
						to working at home or at the gym.
					</p>

		<h3>3. Health Tracking App (Hydration, heart rate, food intake, and other health metrics)</h3>
	
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> As people begin to live busier lives, it can be easy to forget about taking care of
						one’s well-being. Many individuals find it hard to monitor their health metrics and
						lifestyle with simple tasks such as forgetting to drink the necessary amount of
						water per day, getting the proper nutrients and vitamins, or failing to realize if vital
						organ functions are working correctly. The challenge here is to provide
						easy-to-understand health information so a user can take proactive approaches
						to living a healthier life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Fitness is crucial when it comes to taking care of health and avoiding illnesses or
						diseases. If individuals are unable to identify their health information, they may
						not be sure about their current fitness levels which could cause them to miss
						information that could have allowed them to take action sooner.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application could help those who are trying to keep their fitness metrics
						in check. Through interactive notifications, users can track if they are hydrated,
						eating the right amount, and moving enough in their day-to-day life. The health
						tracking app could gather and keep track of information about the user to
						personalize health plans. When someone doesn’t have good physical health,
						it can trickle down to other vital components such as mental health, which can
						affect the user’s overall life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will be used to provide quick and easy recommendations to
						enhance the user’s wellbeing.

			<h3>Map Activity & Events Recommender</h3>
			<p> Our project is a mobile application available on iOS and Android that will connect event
				planners with individuals looking to participate in activities happening in their city. The app
				will display a map of the city the user is currently in, similar to Google Maps, with pins
				dropped in locations that correspond to activities such as “impromptu basketball”, “secret
				donut shop”, “city scavenger hunt” and other events. The system will be used when a user
				opens the application, explores the events happening around them, selects an event to view
				the location and details, and can click a button to open the address in Google Maps and
				navigate to the event location. For event planners, they will be able to tap a button to create
				an event, provide information like the address, time, and description, add keywords that
				describe the event, and press submit which will then drop a pin on the map for all users to
				see. The system is meant to be used by any individuals over the age of 18 that have spare
				time and an interest in exploring the city and participating in various activities. It will also be
				used by any small businesses or organizations that wish to put together events.

			<h3>Event Organizers</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Local Buisnesses</h4>
					<p> These businesses may be interested in creating unique marketing
						campaigns that involve customers visiting their location. Examples of
						this include “Free donuts for first 50 customers” or “Spin the wheel to
						win a prize, while getting coffee from our shop”.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>City Planners (Government Officials)</h4>
					<p> The government may want to organize events such as firework shows
						during holidays like Canada Day. This app would allow them to design
						a more robust experience and inform more citizens of what is planned.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Charities and Non-Profit Organizations</h4>
					<p> These organizations may put together charity events and fundraisers
						with games and activities to entice people to visit and get informed
						about their mission.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Everday People</h4>
					<p> Our application is really intended for use by anyone who wants
						to organize an event, whether its something official and formal like
						a professional conference for a corporation or just an informal meetup
						between a group of freinds.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Event Participants</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Any local citizen over the age of 18</h4>
					<p>	As this app is meant to be accessible by everyone over 18, this
						ensures the safety of individuals being able to check out any events
						that cater to them.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Any local citizen over the age of 18</h4>
					<p> When a tourist is visiting a new city, they may be interested in
						checking out local events during the duration of their visit to make the
						most of their experience.

		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<h4>Ask - Surveys & Questionnaires</h4>
			<p> The questions were asked to ascertain certain characteristics and understand the users who
				would be interested in this product. We interviewed 26 people that could be potential users
				of the application, and we had a large variety of people ranging from different ages,
				backgrounds, lifestyles, etc. From the responses given, here are a few things that were
				noticed: The majority of users were not familiar with event planning applications. Many
				people only go to these events once or twice a week (mainly because they find out about
				these events from all over the place), and the average person who replied was not a full
				blown introvert or extrovert, the average was a 7. Doing a survey was very beneficial for our
				research as it did give us a better understanding of our audience (the average user), we
				could elicit replies quick and easy, and we were able to distribute the survey to many people.
				Combined, these factors are what went well for us. What went poorly was there was a
				misunderstanding with a question. When people were asked how they found their events,
				they didn’t seem to comprehend the question fully based on replies given. The wording was
				not clear, leading to lots of outliers. To improve, we could have changed the wording to be
				more clear and concise so the responders of the survey give more accurate answers. If we
				did that differently, the better responses would have helped.
			</p>
		
			<h4>Learn - Competitive Product Survey</h4>
			<p> Pre-existing products were reviewed in order to set a base for which features would need to
				be implemented, and which features are flawed and should not be implemented in our app.
				We reviewed four most frequently used event apps. By looking at these apps, we got a
				better idea of features that would need to be implemented within our system. As many of
				these competitive products have been around for a long time now, they can be used as a
				base point to build on and improve products. The features that we noticed that were
				impressive and we would like to implement and adopt can be found in the appendix.
				Competitive product surveys were beneficial as they allowed us to analyse, see and
				experience what similar apps in the market are currently looking like, and help define our
				own app’s functional requirements. One of the main issues that we encountered during this
				research was that a lot of apps had overlap, making it difficult to figure out which system or
				approach would be best implemented. Another issue looking into each product’s functionality
				and getting the pros and cons was time-consuming. For next time, it would be better if we
				did the competitive product survey with an audience and asked them questions about it to
				get more opinions. 
			</p>
	
			<h4>Try - Scenario Testing</h4>
			<p>	Three different scenarios were brainstormed to try and succinctly cover and express our
				application’s possible functionalities. At the same time we tried to tailor each of these
				scenarios to serve as an embodiment of different potential user perspectives like that of a
				tourist or small business owner. These were given to six potential users to elicit feedback
				and it was a great way to get feedback on the different functionalities that we would like to
				have in our app. In terms of what went well, some of the scenarios got the interviewees
				really excited about the application as they had either never heard of an event planner app
				like ours and really wanted to have something like it. The scenarios were good at eliciting
				more elaboration from some of the interviewees; getting what they thought about the 
				application and based on the three scenarios, the interviewees had a good understanding of
				the system. Some participants thought that the scenarios were too specific and were
				confused, so they often needed guiding questions to give proper feedback. Others thought
				they were too general and they forgot the main functionality of the app and would get lost in
				them. Next time, we should first use some other more initializing research methods that can
				inform our scenarios and help us flesh them out better. Finally, having more than three
				scenarios with a good mix of specific and general cases could help us cover more ground as
				there seems to be a hit-and-miss for how general or specific the scenarios should be.

			<h3>Map Activity & Events Recommender</h3>
			<p> Our project will be an event organization application intended for use on iOS and
				Android mobile platforms. The application will allow registered users to create, browse
				and find events in their local area or anywhere around the world. An intuitive and
				interactive map interface will be central to the app, allowing users to explore and learn
				about what events are going on in their region or city as well as how best to get there.
				Event planners will be able to create and work with highly customizable event pages
				that can be tailored to variable levels of detail in order to provide potential participants
				with all the information they need to engage in the event. Users searching for an event
				will have a choice between a robust search system or an active “Event Finder” feature.
				The Search system will allow users to explore a selection of events in their area based
				on a variety of search factors such as time, distance, event capacity, event type,
				organizer profiles and so on. To further enhance the power of the search system, events
				will be defined and categorized by tags as selected by event creators.

			<p> From our analysis, we noticed that most of the tasks were easy to walk through
				however, there were some confusing icons and labels. Users might not understand what
				some icons mean such as the filter and event status symbols which would require them
				to learn and experiment. The user might also not immediately know just by looking
				which icons are clickable and interactive. We decided to modify this by using common
				icons like checks and exes to indicate yes and no. In addition, we added colour to
				certain icons so that green would indicate “good” and red would indicate “bad”. We also
				found that the ability to do a task in different ways, such as finding an event, was useful.
				The interface with the map is familiar to most people from apps like Google Maps, and it
				was intuitive that you could interact with the map and click on events. Compared to our
				tasks in stage two, we decided not to implement the “passive” and “active” status from
				stage two as it didn’t seem to match the actual use case of the core event finding
				functionality.

			<p> What went well for this stage was our initial prototyping session where everyone created
				similar, yet different representations of the app. We all had a great, common
				understanding of the app’s objectives and this allowed us to have cohesive design
				elements. It was also easy to collaborate on integrating all of the prototypes together to
				show our vertical tasks since we used Balsamiq Cloud, though actual integration itself
				was still a challenge. Furthermore, it was helpful for our group to ask questions to
				Philmo who helped clarify information regarding the affinity diagrams and prototypes.
				What went poorly was that we felt slightly crunched for time due to the amount of tasks
				that were required which didn’t allow us to be as creative as we could have been. The
				amount of tasks required also led to some time management issues for our time.
				Additionally, the affinity diagram was hard to understand which made us spend too
				much time on the early portions of this stage. What we would do differently is to firstly
				have been more organized with our approach to this stage since there were so many
				tasks. We could have created a concrete schedule and structure, as well as had more
				frequent meetings with each other. Secondly, the prototyping portion helped us realize
				what was feasible and what was overly ambitious for this stage. As a result, we will
				more closely analyze the feasibility of our ideas in the future.

			<h3>Map Activity & Events Recommender</h3>
			<p> Our project will be an event organization application intended for use on iOS and
				Android mobile platforms. The application will allow registered users to create, browse
				and find events in their local area or anywhere around the world. An intuitive and
				interactive map interface will be central to the app, allowing users to explore and learn
				about what events are going on in their region or city as well as how best to get there.
				Event planners will be able to create and work with highly customizable event pages
				that can be tailored to variable levels of detail in order to provide potential participants
				with all the information they need to engage in the event. Users searching for an event
				will have a choice between a robust search system or an active “Event Finder” feature.
				The Search system will allow users to explore a selection of events in their area based
				on a variety of search factors such as time, distance, event capacity, event type,
				organizer profiles and so on. To further enhance the power of the search system, events
				will be defined and categorized by tags as selected by event creators.

	<div class="card">
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p> The goal of our evaluation was to gauge the usability of our app and find elements in its 
				UI design that were confusing or unclear. We first got a feel for the app and saw how 
				everything flowed. Then three of us individually utilized Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics 
				as a guideline to come up with a scenario and tasks to evaluate our four main tasks for 
				issues and success areas.
			</p>
			<p> Scenario: The long weekend is coming up and Samantha wants to find some new 
				activities to do. She is new to the city and she decides to download Xplore and registers 
				with the hope of finding a dance competition event.
			</p>
			<p> The qualitative part of the evaluation was performing a walkthrough of the system with 
				each of us identifying what we think was a problem. With this, we identified several 
				areas of improvement in the app’s functionality. At this point, the evaluation was 
				subjective, and we had to turn this evaluation into quantitative data. So, we had two 
				testers who rated the severity of the problems from 0 to 4. From those ratings we 
				prioritized the major problems for our next iteration.
			</p>
			<p>Based on the heuristic evaluation, the team will focus on iterating our prototype in this stage by doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement consistent colouring of buttons and design</li>
				<li>Implement error messages for when the user wants to create an event but leaves fields empty</li>
				<li>Indicate that horizontal scrolling is possible in the manage events sections</li>
				<li>Implement more navigation options so user does not have to always reset</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Review and Findings</h3>
			<p> There were many positive findings but also some major negative ones which needed to 
				be fixed before moving on. The important things to note were that we did not have any 
				issues that were classified as a level 4, which would indicate a usability catastrophe. 
				The usability heuristics ‘visibility of system’s status’, ‘matching between system and real 
				world’, and ‘recognition rather than recall’ had several positive findings that were 
				compliant with the heuristic principles and enhanced the experience with our app. We 
				found that there were plenty of indicators to let the user know what is happening when 
				they do major tasks like signing up for an event, and the familiar icons and simple 
				language made it fairly easy to use the system. Our negative findings lied with the 
				‘consistency and standards’, ‘error prevention’ usability heuristics. In our iteration we 
				decided to implement consistent colouring of buttons and our main design in terms of layout of 
				the buttons and text boxes. We also implemented error messages for when the 
				user is creating an event but accidentally leaves critical fields empty.

			<p> What went well for this stage was how we were able to frequently meet up after reading 
				break to deal with the time crunch. We were able to work around everyone’s schedules 
				and kept in constant communication. Since we worked hard on stage three with our 
				low-fi prototype, we were able to take those ideas and build on them, utilizing them as a 
				foundation rather than starting from scratch. We also reviewed feedback from stage 
				three to better understand the objectives of the stage. What went poorly was that Figma 
				was initially difficult to learn and this slowed down the progression of the project. We 
				also did not use all of Figma’s features effectively which may have led to many 
				inefficiencies during our prototyping sessions, creating more work for ourselves than we 
				needed. We also did not have sufficient meetings early on in stage four and this led to a 
				time crunch near the end which complicated our workflow and stressed us out. In terms 
				of what we would do differently, we would have planned more time to learn Figma by 
				watching video tutorials and using additional online learning resources. We also would 
				want to start our initial meetings earlier in the stage in order to prevent time crunches at 
				the end.
